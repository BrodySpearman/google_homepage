This is a basic mini-project to recreate the google homepage. This project should help me train me with utilizing git practically as well as showing knowledge of <html> and CSS concpts.

Post-project: I learned a lot about utilizing CSS to manipulate elements to my liking. Easy project but great experience learning the in and outs of formatting with <html> and CSS.
